description: As a traveler, some facilities can be difficult to find when having to search online in new languages. For this reason, I built this Laravel-based location search website to allow me to find laundromats and public services on the move. Written with TDD in mind, I built the locations and search options as well as imported scraping scripts to allow me to upload maps from multiple other websites.
